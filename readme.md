- Terraform - You can download Terraform [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

The following chapters will guide you through the process on how to get started in regards to the working environment and outline some example deployments. This will give you a basic undertanding of immutable infrastrucure in Azure using Terraform and GitHub.

## 2. Starting the first Terraform project

Starting off into the IAC world with Terraform means getting some best practices in place. A good strating point is a a book or reference guide. From my personal experience, I would tend to [Terraform: Up & Running, 2nd Edition](https://www.terraformupandrunning.com/) by Yevgeniy (Jim) Brikman.
